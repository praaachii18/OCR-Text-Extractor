## 🚀 Installation & Setup (Windows)

### Step 1 — Clone / Download the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/praaachii18/ocr_text_extractor
cd ocr_text_extractor
```

### Step 2 — Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3 — Install PyTorch (CPU version — smallest download)

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

> ℹ️ For GPU (NVIDIA CUDA 11.8):
> ```bash
> pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
> ```

### Step 4 — Install all other dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⏳ EasyOCR will download language model files (~100 MB) on first run. This is normal.

### Step 5 — (Optional) Install Poppler for PDF support

PDF input requires Poppler:

1. Download the latest Windows build from:  
   👉 https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases
2. Extract the ZIP (e.g. to `C:\poppler\`)
3. Add `C:\poppler\Library\bin` to your Windows **PATH** environment variable

## ▶ Running the App

### In VS Code

1. Open the `ocr_text_extractor/` folder in VS Code
2. Open the terminal (`Ctrl + ~`)
3. Make sure your venv is active: `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. The app opens automatically at **http://localhost:8501**

### Stop the app

Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## 🔧 How to Use

1. **Upload** a JPG, PNG, or PDF file using the upload box
2. **Configure** preprocessing in the left sidebar (grayscale, denoise, threshold, scale)
3. **Select** OCR language(s) from the sidebar
4. Click **🔍 Extract Text**
5. View the result in the output box with confidence score
6. **Copy**, **Save as TXT**, or **Export as PDF**

## ⚙ Preprocessing — What Each Step Does

### Why preprocessing matters

Raw images often have noise, low resolution, or poor contrast. Preprocessing converts them into clean black-and-white images that OCR engines can read much more accurately.

| Step | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Grayscale** | Strips colour information, reduces complexity | Almost always |
| **Upscale** | Enlarges image so small text becomes readable | Small text, thumbnails |
| **Denoise** | Removes JPEG compression artifacts and grain | Scanned photos, screenshots |
| **Adaptive Threshold** | Binarises image (black text on white bg) | Documents, invoices, receipts |
| **Deskew** | Corrects skewed/rotated documents | Scanned pages, phone photos |

### Accuracy tips

- For **printed documents**: enable all preprocessing steps
- For **screenshots**: grayscale + threshold is usually enough
- For **handwriting**: disable threshold (it can break strokes)
- For **small text**: increase Upscale Factor to 3.0–4.0
- For **PDF scans**: enable all steps + set DPI to 200+

## ❌ Common Errors & Fixes

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'easyocr'`
```bash
pip install easyocr
```

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'`
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pdf2image'`
```bash
pip install pdf2image
# Also install Poppler (see Step 5 above)
```

### PDF extraction fails with "Unable to get page count"
- Poppler is not installed or not in PATH
- Download from the link in Step 5 and add to Windows PATH

### EasyOCR downloads models every run
- Models are cached in `~/.EasyOCR/model/` after first download
- Subsequent runs are instant

### App is very slow on first OCR run
- EasyOCR loads a neural network (~100 MB) into memory
- This takes 5–15 seconds on first run per session
- Subsequent extractions in the same session are fast

### `StreamlitAPIException` / page config error
- Make sure `st.set_page_config()` is the very first Streamlit call in `app.py`
- Don't call any Streamlit function before it

### Low confidence / wrong text
- Increase the Upscale Factor in the sidebar
- Enable all preprocessing options
- Make sure the correct language is selected
- For very low-quality images, try a higher-resolution scan
