- Supports JPG, PNG, and JPEG formats
- Clean and user-friendly interface
- Fast text processing
- Copy extracted text easily
- Works with scanned documents and screenshots
- Error handling for unsupported files
- Real-time extracted text display

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- Pillow (PIL)
- Tesseract OCR
- NumPy
